Dungeon Fighter Online is an arcade-type belt-scrolling action game mixed with RPG elements and epic storyline.

Originally known as Dungeon & Fighter in Korea, the korea server (kDNF) allows public access to its open source application programming interface (API) containing various in-game information, most notably character information showing the character's equipment and status. Other information includes character ranking, item quality of the day, item data, equipment farming guide, growth simulator, etc.

Using the data available from API, kDNF game community/players have built and managed game server information websites, where the public is able to view in-game information without logging into the game. Notable websites are as followed:
