## __DFO API Work Showcase__

#### <ins>Introduction</ins>

Dungeon Fighter Online is an arcade-type belt-scrolling action game mixed with RPG elements and epic storyline.

Originally known as Dungeon & Fighter in Korea, the korea server (kDNF) allows public access to its open source application programming interface (API) containing various in-game information, most notably character information showing the character's equipment and status. Other information includes character ranking, item quality of the day, item data, equipment farming guide, growth simulator, etc.

Using the data available from API, kDNF game community/players have built and managed game server information websites, where the public is able to view in-game information without logging into the game. Notable websites are:
* https://dunfaoff.com/
* https://dfcat.net/

#### <ins>Global Server</ins>

In 2015, the game developer Neople Inc. dedicated a group to manage a global-based server of the same game under the name Dungeon Fighter Online (DFO or DFOG) to cater for players around the world (except for a few countries with their own local game server). <br>
Official website: https://www.dfoneople.com/

Since the global server is managed by Neople staff directly, DFOG game stats (in terms of content difficulty, item stats, etc) largely follow kDNF. As such, DFOG players would often visit the kDNF community built websites for references (mostly on equipment builds). Since then, there have been request by the DFOG players to release the game server API for similar purposes. 

On 9 Nov 2022, Neople conducted a survey for demand of API for DFOG server (https://www.dfoneople.com/news/notices/3143/Survey-Regarding-Demand-for-DFO-API?page=1). The survey includes showing work experience of using API and website building. On 12 Jan 2023, the ExStream Q&A session has confirmed that the release of DFPG API is approved. However, the sentiment may not be that positive when it comes to utilizing API and building websites.
Survey results as followed:

#### <ins>Work Goal</ins>

This project/work serves as an effort to showcase my own knowledge and experience in utilizing API to extract information in order to boost the developer's confidence in releaseing the API. It could also encourage the game community to look into utilizing the API for the benefits of all players. This work also acts as a work showcase for the survey conducted.
